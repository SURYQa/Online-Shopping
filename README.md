**Project Report: Online Shopping Platform**

**1. Introduction:**

The Online Shopping Project is a Spring Boot web application designed for efficient online shopping experiences. Utilizing Java, Hibernate JPA, Maven, Lombok, Spring Security, HTML, CSS, and MySQL, the application focuses on user registration, secure login, and seamless order placement.

**2. Technologies Used:**

- **Spring Boot:** For simplified application development.
- **Java:** As the primary programming language.
- **Hibernate JPA:** Facilitates database interactions.
- **Maven:** Manages project dependencies.
- **Lombok:** Reduces boilerplate code in Java.
- **Spring Security:** Ensures secure user authentication.
- **HTML and CSS:** Shapes the user interface.
- **MySQL:** Stores user and product information.
- **Maven Repository:** Centralized dependency management.

**3. Project Structure:**

The project adheres to a simplified Maven project structure. Key components include:

- **Controller:** Manages application flow and user requests.
- **Service:** Implements business logic, utilizing DTOs.
- **Repository:** Handles database operations with Spring Data JPA.
- **Security:** Configures security settings.

**4. User Registration and Authentication:**

Users register by providing their first name, last name, email, and password. The application employs Spring Security for secure user authentication, ensuring data confidentiality.

**5. Login Page:**

A user-friendly login page prompts users to enter their registered email and password for authentication.

**6. Main Page:**

Upon successful login, users access the main page featuring a product catalog. The page includes a logout button for secure session termination.

**7. Product Pages:**

Each product is clickable, redirecting users to detailed product pages. These pages showcase essential product information.

**8. Order Placement:**

Users can place orders by clicking the "Submit Order" button on the product page. A prompt displays an alert message, confirming successful order placement. A 3-second delay precedes redirecting users back to the main page.

**9. Conclusion:**

The Online Shopping Project demonstrates the integration of technologies to create a secure and user-friendly e-commerce platform. The absence of a traditional model layer is compensated by the use of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for streamlined data exchange.

**10. Future Enhancements:**

- Implementation of user roles (admin, customer).
- Integration with payment gateways for actual transactions.
- Enhanced product catalog features.
- Addition of order history and tracking functionalities.
